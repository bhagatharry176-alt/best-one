## Recent Changes

### September 13, 2025 - Successful Render Migration
- **Status**: âœ… Bot successfully running on Render with full functionality
- **Fixed Flask templating issues**: Downgraded to Flask 2.2.5 for compatibility
- **Resolved Pyrogram conflicts**: Removed PyroFork, clean install of Pyrogram 2.0.106
- **Eliminated circular import**: Removed top-level aiofiles imports causing startup failures
- **Standardized imports**: Using public API imports for better stability
- **Enhanced error handling**: Added comprehensive diagnostics in render_start.py

## System Architecture

### Core Framework
- **Telegram Client**: Pyrogram with TgCrypto for secure and efficient Telegram API interactions
- **Web Server**: Flask application for health checks and deployment compatibility
- **Async Processing**: Asyncio-based architecture for concurrent operations

### Modular Design Pattern
The application follows a modular architecture with separate handlers for different functionalities:
- Authorization module for user access control
- Broadcast module for mass messaging
- DRM handler for encrypted content processing
- YouTube handler for video downloads
- HTML handler for web content extraction
- Text handler for document conversion
- Utils module for common utilities

### Authentication & Authorization
- Owner-based access control with configurable authorized users
- Environment variable-based configuration for security
- Support for both individual user authorization and broadcast user lists

### Content Processing Pipeline
- Multi-format video download support (YouTube, DRM-protected content)
- Quality selection and optimization
- Temporary file management with automatic cleanup
- Progress tracking and user feedback

### Memory Management
- Render-optimized memory management for 512MB RAM environments
- Aggressive cleanup mechanisms to prevent memory leaks
- Temporary file cleanup after processing

### Download Optimization
- Aria2c integration for enhanced download speeds
- Concurrent fragment downloads
- Retry mechanisms and error handling
- Platform-specific optimizations for Railway and Render
